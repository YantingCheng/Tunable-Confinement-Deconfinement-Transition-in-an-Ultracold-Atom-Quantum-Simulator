# Tunable-Confinement-Deconfinement-Transition-in-an-Ultracold-Atom-Quantum-Simulator

The one-dimensional lattice Schwinger model has recently been realized by using bosons in optical lattices. This model contanins both confinement and deconfinement phases. whose phase diagram is controlled by the mass of the matter field and the topological angle. We propose that direct experiment evidence of confinement and deconfinement can be obtained by measuring whether a physical charge is localized around a fixed gauge charge to screen it. We also discuss the PXP model realized in the Rydberg atoms array, which is equivalent to the lattice Schwinger model when all local gauge charges arre fixed to zero.

The document named 'movement' calculates the movement of the particle or hole which is added into the ground state. And the document named 'PXP' calculates the correlation function in PXP model which is described in our paper.
